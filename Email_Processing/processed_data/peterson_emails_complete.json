    "message_body": "Accidentally sent this to Adam@FullCircleMarketing.co ---------- Forwarded message --------- From: Peterson Rainey  Date: Sat, Sep 27, 2025 at 12:35 PM Subject: Getting Started To:  I can't seem to find access to the ads@FullCircleMarketing.co account. You could send that login information over again, that would be great. Additionally, for Google Ads accounts, I'll be setting up a Manager account underneath my Creekside Manager account that is called Full Circle Marketing. This way, I can have all Google Ads accounts plugged in to my MCC account and easily access all the ad accounts you guys send over to me while still appearing as a direct operator of Full Circle Marketing. For the Facebook accounts, I'll probably just get it shared to my personal account because that's what I have access to. All of my ad accounts are through my personal account, and there's typically issues with business emails getting access to Business Manager accounts in my experience. Just want to give you a quick update on what's going on there. If we could keep communication strictly to Slack, that way all of my team members are able to see all of the strategy/updates on clients that we discuss and are also able to directly communicate with you when needed. That way we don't have to go back and forth between different emails. I've set up forwarding for this email to send it to my business email. If I need to communicate with new clients about onboarding and stuff like that, that won't be an issue. But once we start working with clients, I would like to keep all of the communication in a dedicated Slack channel. One per client. Or two if we need a Slack channel that doesn't have a client in it. -- *Peterson Rainey* Google Ads + Meta Ads Consultant p. 931-342-4114 *Full Circle Media * www.fullcirclemedia.co @fullcirclemediaco",

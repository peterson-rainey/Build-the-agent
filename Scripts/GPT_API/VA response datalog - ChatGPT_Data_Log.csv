I’ve attached case studies to showcase the results I’ve delivered for clients through strategic campaign optimization. As someone who’s worked with several niche eCommerce brands and who’s spent more than a few weekends out on the disc golf course, I know exactly how valuable a well-targeted campaign can be when you truly understand the audience. With disc golf, it’s not just about interest-based targeting; it’s about speaking to players based on experience level, gear preferences, and what they value (flight path, grip, durability, etc.). If we work together, I’ll build campaigns that tap into those nuances, use shopping and search campaigns to highlight bestsellers and seasonal pushes, and track performance through GA4 and UTM-backed reporting. I’ve helped brands turn passionate hobbyist communities into loyal customer bases, and I’d love to bring that same energy and clarity to your ad strategy. Let’s connect! I’d be excited to help grow your reach and your brand in a sport I genuinely enjoy. -Samuel Rainey case study #1 advanced med spa.pdf Case Study # 2 lawnvalue.pdf Case Study #3 axle solutions.pdf Case Study #4 Landmark.pdf Case Study #5 polaris dentistry.pdf"

2025-07-10,2,1,Direct pricing inquiry,B2B_Finance,Budget inquiry with value proposition,Interest confirmation + Budget question + Value hint,,,"Initial outreach from lead, establishing contact and interest","If your top of funnel traffic isn’t being qualified by intent tier and investor profile, there’s a high chance your pixel is mislearning and over-indexing on curiosity clicks. For real estate funds, especially 506(c) raises, I’d tighten audience signals using income proxies + lookalike layering from verified investor lists or high-LTV segments. Combine that with a quiz-style LP or tiered lead capture, and you’ll see an immediate lift in quality, while staying compliant. I’ve worked across 200+ ad accounts and helped manage $20M+ in spend across Meta and Google. On investor-facing campaigns, I zero in on pre-qualification via creative and copy. So by the time someone hits your CRM, they’re aligned on capital, timeline, and trust. Do you have a sense yet of how you’re planning to segment investor types (accredited vs. not)? That’ll help shape both the funnel structure and compliance strategy. Happy to jump in on campaign setup and optimization, and collaborate as you scale. Let me know if you’d like to connect. Samuel Case Study #5 Digital Marketing (1).pdf Case Study Digital Marketing.pdf Case Study #4 Digital Marketing (3).pdf Case Study # 2 Digital Marketing (2).pdf Case Study #3 Digital Marketing (2).pdf Alex S. 8:06 PM Thanks for the proposal, Samuel. Some questions in lieu of a lengthy discussion (though a short one will likely still be useful later). Please respond even if you already covered it in the original proposal, so that I see side by side for the short list of pros that I've added you to. 1. Describe a Meta ad campaign you’ve managed from start to finish. What was the goal, audience, budget, and outcome? 2. Have you run ads for real estate investment funds, syndications, capital raises (especially 506(c) raises) where a product sale was not the goal? 3. If so, describe the campaign and any compliance or targeting challenges you handled, including KPIs achieved. 4. Which tools do you use to create or edit ad creatives (static or video)? Share a link to 1–2 ad creatives you developed or edited. 5. Give an example of an A/B test you ran that significantly improved campaign performance. What variable did you test and what did you learn? 6. How do you balance lead quantity vs. lead quality in your ad campaigns, particularly for higher-ticket offers like investor acquisition? 7. Which AI tools have you used in your ad campaigns (e.g. copywriting, creative, automation)? How have they improved your workflow or results? 8. What are some red flags you watch for in underperforming campaigns, and how do you troubleshoot them? 9. What’s your typical turnaround time for launching a new campaign once provided with assets and brief? What’s your availability per week? 10. How many hours would it be to launch a campaign and how many hours weekly to maintain? Thank you. Friday, Jul 11"
2025-07-10,2,2,Direct pricing inquiry,B2B_Finance,Budget inquiry with value proposition,Interest confirmation + Budget question + Value hint,,,"First response from lead, showing interest and asking questions","1. I managed a Meta Ads campaign for a multi-location med spa in Atlanta. The goal was lead generation for high-ticket services like laser treatments and body sculpting. The audience included women 30–55 in specific zip codes, layered with income and interest-based targeting. The monthly budget was around $5,000. I built the funnel from scratch, using lead forms and a retargeting sequence. We A/B tested multiple creatives and offers. The result: cost per lead was one-fifth the industry average, and we doubled appointment volume in under 60 days. 2. I haven’t run ads specifically for 506(c) capital raises, but I’ve worked with a wide variety of businesses that required strategic lead generation with high compliance standards and long sales cycles. That experience allows me to bring insights and testing strategies from multiple industries to campaigns like these—something many niche-only marketers can’t offer. 3. While I don’t have direct experience with real estate syndications or 506(c) raises, I’ve managed Facebook and Google Ads in industries with strict compliance rules—like healthcare, financial services, and local service businesses that require legally compliant landing pages and disclaimers. In those projects, I navigated Meta’s ad approval process, implemented custom audience segmentation, and balanced educational content with direct-response tactics. That cross-industry experience gives me a clear edge in navigating compliance challenges even if the product isn’t one I’ve previously advertised. 4. See Below, a couple from a recent campaign we launched. 5. For a home services client, we tested an A/B split between two lead form strategies: one with minimal fields and one with more qualifying questions. While the short form drove more leads, the long form produced leads that were 3× more likely to convert to paying customers. The lesson: lead quality sometimes trumps quantity, and testing different friction levels in the form flow is key. 6. I segment the funnel by intent. For top-of-funnel, I use video views and engagement to warm up the audience. For middle- and bottom-of-funnel, I focus on longer lead forms, trust-building creatives, and clear value propositions to filter out non-qualified leads. I also use retargeting to drive re-engagement. Lead quality always takes precedence over vanity metrics—especially when the end offer is high-ticket. 7. I use ChatGPT for rapid A/B testing of ad copy, AI helps me produce more test variations at speed, identify patterns across campaigns, and reduce setup time without sacrificing quality. 8. Biggest red flags: low CTR, high CPL, and no conversion data after 72 hours of spend. I immediately check for creative fatigue, poor audience targeting, landing page disconnect, or pixel/conversion API tracking issues. I also review placement reports and audience overlap to prevent wasted spend. 9. If assets and access are ready, I can launch within 7 business days. 10. I don't bill hourly for management. If that's not a deal breaker, I'll send my fee breakdown next. Alex S. 3:06 PM Samuel, are you saying that you bill a flat fee for campaign management? Please send fee breakdown. Thanks.

Quick question. How is your fluency with Unbounce? Monday, Jul 07","Turn 25 in conversation, continuing discussion","For sure, you can check out my profile, it's got a few well put together case studies and reviews that I include in all of my proposals. We haven't worked with any businesses specifically in snacks/supplements, but we have worked with a several health & food related business. One specializes in custom retainers you make at home, with an average repeat purchase time of 6 months, so retargeting campaigns to keep people purchasing probably aren't as prevelant as they would be in a snacks or supplements ads account (however I'm sure there are some supplement brands that would a few months before repurchase, not sure if that is relevant to the clients you have currently) but they definitely play a role, and this will be super important to improving the LTV of clients in this niche. we also work with a couple of dental practices and a med spa, while not directly related to the current client you are pursuing, I know you may have an interest in health related businesses that need lead gen over purchases, so just wanted to highlight that we have experience in those a well. Working with another partner to run ads for their local meal prep delivery services, really focusing on building out a local brand/personality for these specific businesses to compete against the nationwide chains. awareness and traffic campaigns are huge here because they drive demand for the product farther down the funnel, and keep the business top of mind for current clients to drive regular repurchases. It's such a cliche, but every business really is unique, and it helps to be able to pull from experience across a wide variety of industries to find the best strategy for any particular market/industry/location.

Proven B2B Experience - I’ve managed multiple B2B campaigns targeting niche decision-makers, ranging from manufacturing equipment suppliers to logistics and fulfillment tech. My experience includes building conversion-focused funnels that move users from search intent to form fill or quote request, all while controlling CPL. Strategy-First Approach - For a brand like yours, I’d implement a tight SKAG or themed ad group structure, focusing on exact and phrase match keywords relevant to packaging materials, machinery, and service terms. I’d layer that with a robust negative keyword list to trim wasted spend—especially important in industrial verticals with ambiguous search terms. Real Results - For a B2B manufacturer, I reduced CPL by 38% by shifting from broad match + manual bids to segmented exact match campaigns with tCPA bidding. - I’ve used Maximize Conversions and tCPA bidding strategies effectively, especially once historical data supports automation. - Weekly ROAS and CPL reporting? Standard in my process—delivered with insights, not just numbers. Tools + Technical - Google Ads Certified - GA4, Tag Manager, and Looker Studio for reporting - Comfortable collaborating with in-house or outsourced design/dev teams on landing pages and tracking fixes. - Happy to start with a quick audit or jump straight into refining your current campaigns.

As a result, they saw a 46% drop in cost per lead and significantly better call volume from the same budget.

Thx!,,"Initial outreach from lead, establishing contact and interest","Hi there, I've helped multiple premium fitness and wellness brands successfully generate high-quality leads through Meta Ads, particularly those selling products in the $1,500+ range. One example: I worked with a wellness client offering a high-end infrared sauna product (priced at $3,000+). We built a funnel that combined interest-based cold traffic campaigns with lead forms and a strong retargeting layer. After three weeks of testing creative angles and optimizing the lead form and landing page copy, we reduced cost per lead by 45% and increased qualified scheduled calls by over 60% month-over-month. Another campaign was for a fitness equipment startup launching a premium smart rowing machine ($1,800+ MSRP). We tested different hooks focused on results (e.g., “Transform your home workouts in 20 minutes a day”) and aligned creatives with buyer personas (busy professionals, parents, etc.). The result was a 4.2 ROAS on top-of-funnel campaigns and a CPA below $25 for booked demos. Here’s How I’d Approach Your Campaign: - Audit & Funnel Strategy: Review your current campaign structure and user journey. Identify gaps in creative alignment and conversion touchpoints. - Creative Testing: Suggest new hooks and visuals that speak to transformation, luxury, or exclusivity, critical in high-ticket consumer marketing. - Audience Mapping: Use interest stacking and lookalikes from past converters to refine targeting. - Performance Tracking: Set up clean lead conversion tracking (pixel + offline event sync, if applicable) and provide clear weekly reports focused on CPA, lead quality, and ROAS. I'd love to learn more about your brand and goals. If you're open to a short call, I can walk you through additional examples and share a game plan tailored to your product.

Wednesday, May 28","Hey Sam – thanks again for the call yesterday. . We’d love to get a fixed-price proposal and a few examples of SaaS clients you’ve worked with — ideally early-stage or KPI-focused. Also wanted your take on something: With Google’s recent push toward AI-driven ad formats and the “metatization” of ads (video, image, logo, etc. for Performance Max), do you think it’s necessary to build those assets from the start? Or can we drive strong bottom-funnel results with a search-only campaign while we validate traction? Appreciate your insight!","Turn 7 in conversation, continuing discussion","What kind of budget are you looking to start with, and what budget are you looking to scale to? I typically do percent of ad spend, as it is cheaper up front for my clients, and allows us both to win as we grow. happy to do a fixed price if needed tho. SaaS businesses I work with right now: ReferPro, they do referral automations for home service businesses. Zamplo, bulk land data software for real estate investors. Medwriter, AI notetaker for the medical industry. all of these have started in past few years. for your long term growth, it will definitely be a need to use those format in order to scale your ads effectively, and typically its a good sign if you are using them because it means you have the conversions to do so. However, it's not possible to use them effectively without collecting conv. data first. (demand gen can work out the gate going after clicks when you have solid customer/lead data to build lookalike remarketing campaigns around, but new accounts often don't get access to customer match right away). long story short, most of the time you need to drive bottom funnel conversions with search campaigns using high intent search terms not only to validate that google is right for your business, but to begin using the more visual aspects of the google ads platform. hope that answers your questions, and happy to go into more detail if need be!

This is something we can discuss in much more detail on our strategy call, so I apologize if I glossed over anything in this quick explanation I charge 20% of ad spend up to $10k, 10% of all spend between $10k - $30k, and 5% for everything over $30k. minimum fee is $600 per month (only relevant if you are spending less than $3k per month)"

For clients spending $250K+/month, I focus on creative strategy, funnel structure, and high-frequency testing to scale while protecting ROAS. For example, I managed Meta Ads for a fast-growing DTC wellness brand spending $300K+/month. We scaled their evergreen campaigns through a combination of offer testing, UGC ad formats, and creative refresh cycles every 10–14 days. My restructuring of Advantage+ Shopping campaigns helped lift ROAS by 22% while improving efficiency at the top of the funnel. I also worked closely with their in-house team on creative briefs, breaking down which angles were working based on CTRs, thumbstop ratios, and hook retention. Another example: I helped an outdoor lifestyle brand increase Meta ROAS by 31% month-over-month while spending $150K+. I led weekly calls with the founders, presented creative learnings with data, and advised on new audience segments and offer structures for retention vs acquisition. I’m comfortable on Slack and Zoom (including client-facing calls), available 10+ hours/week, and I always aim to be proactive with communication, testing plans, and insights that move the needle.

Here's a quick recap of what we discussed and the recommendations going forward based on your current Facebook and Google Ads setup: 🔍 Facebook Ads Audit & Recommendations Your current strategy is centered around boosted Instagram posts, which has worked previously but is now showing signs of fatigue. To prevent performance drop-offs like you’ve recently experienced, we discussed diversifying your ad structure into a full-funnel approach: Top-of-Funnel: Awareness and engagement campaigns to reach new potential clients Middle-of-Funnel: Click campaigns to drive traffic from engaged users Bottom-of-Funnel: Maximize conversion campaigns focused on consultations booked We also talked about improving your conversion tracking, so you can retarget visitors to your Instagram profile and website more effectively. 🚀 Expansion Into Other Platforms The same full-funnel strategy can be applied to TikTok and Snapchat ads to build additional lead channels and increase overall campaign resilience. Having multiple platforms and multiple touchpoints creates a more robust and scalable marketing system. 🔎 Google Ads Strategy & Timeline We briefly covered launching Google Ads and what to expect over the first 90 days: Month 1: Focus on data collection — get enough clicks to generate initial conversions Month 2: Optimize and aim for 30+ conversions per month to train the algorithm Month 3: Shift toward profitability by implementing Target CPA or Max Conversion strategies A key opportunity here is optimizing for consultations booked rather than generic leads to improve ROI and conversion quality. ✅ Next Steps Build out diversified Facebook campaigns across the full funnel Set up stronger conversion tracking for retargeting and better optimization Replicate this strategy across other platforms (TikTok, Snapchat) Begin planning the initial Google Ads buildout with proper expectations for the 90-day ramp-up"

Initially, I'd like to start out and see how they work through the consolidation of my accounts (which after some thought, I beleive the easiest thing to do is simply use one of the existing ""approved"" accounts and consolidate all of them) and then setting up conversion tracking. Also, probably setting up an initial run of campaigns for my different areas. And for the G2, I already have that. It's required for me as a ""health insurance advertiser"". I have been verified for my old accounts, the problem was getting my new account verified, but again, I'm thinking I'll just move on and not bother creating and reverifying a new account and instead use an existing one. Friday, Apr 18","Turn 8 in conversation, continuing discussion","Yes, consolidating them into an already approved account would probably be easiest. This is definitely something I can help with, and it would probably be best if we hopped on a call to talk through more details, and you can find out if I'm the freelancer for you.

Additionally could use a bit of search term refinement on a regular basis to weed out the irrelevant search terms. Also, could definitely dirve cpc down a good bit by placing some bid caps, and seperating the airbnb and vrbo into their own campaign since they have high cpcs. you'd need to be able to run the campaign for at least 60-90 days to determine if we can hit that 150 mark. first 30 days collecting data, just driving lots of clicks to your site, next 30 to try and hit 30 conversions in 1 month, so third month we can go Max conv and optimize for that target cpa. it can definitely happen sooner, but don't want to give you unrealistic expectations."

In your acct., and that you need about 10+ clicks per day per campaign to get enough data for successful optimizations. Currently the avg cpc is around $17 on Google search, but we could drive this down to around $12-14, possibly $10. We could probably start with just 2 campaigns, and once we figure out which ones work and which don’t, sub in the others to test (keep in mind each campaign needs its own 90 day cycle, but if you already have conversions in the acct from other campaigns, you can cut that to 60 days a lot of the time. All that being said $200 per day would be your bare minimum (testing 2 campaigns) $300 per day is bare minimum for testing all 3 at the same time. Ideally $150 per campaign, but I understand if that’s not in the budget. I wouldn’t recommend any more than $450 per day, as it will be unnecessary for the first 90 of camping optimizations to go any higher. Anything lower than $200 and you’d have to do it all in 1 campaign, which isn’t ideal, as the budget wouldn’t be split up effieciently for testing, but it is doable, however you couldn’t go any lower than $150 per day, as there just wouldn’t be enough data in the campaign to optimize around.

While we currently have someone managing our Google Ads, we've identified certain gaps in expertise. That’s why we’re seeking a stronger, more strategic perspective — someone who can clearly identify what needs to be improved, added, or fixed. We’re ready to pay for your audit, but what we expect in return is real insight and value — something that gives us a stronger edge in the market. If we find that your approach delivers more than what we’re currently working with, we’re open to continuing with you on this and other projects. One more thing to note — Google Ads credentials will not be shared at this stage. However, during the call, we’ll share our screen and walk you through the current setup and performance so you can understand where we stand. We expect to receive your strategic direction first, and based on that, we’ll decide how to proceed. Just to clarify before any call: We’re not interested in past portfolio presentations. What we care about is what you can do specifically for our company, in our industry — not generic case studies. Each business requires its own approach, and we expect yours to be tailored to ours. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.","Hi there, We’re looking for someone to conduct a thorough internal audit of our website, with the goal of improving its performance across Google Ads and other marketing channels.

For New York, I’d build a HIPAA-compliant, geotargeted funnel designed to drive booked consultations, not just traffic. I use lead forms, landing page optimizations, and audience refinement to generate low-cost patient inquiries with high intent. If you're seeing high CPMs or low lead quality right now, I’ve fixed that before and I can do it for you too. The attached case studies show how I’ve scaled patient acquisition at decreasing costs.

I specialize in building and optimizing lead generation funnels for service-based businesses, and this role aligns perfectly with the kind of work I do every day. From audience research to performance tracking and A/B testing, I take a hands-on approach in every campaign. For example, I recently worked with a multi-location HVAC company where we cut the cost per lead by over 35% in just two months by refining our geo-targeting, updating creatives based on scroll behavior, and restructuring the campaigns for better budget allocation. I’m deeply comfortable in both Meta Business Suite and Google Ads Manager, and I leverage GA4 and Facebook Pixel data to consistently generate meaningful insights. My approach is both creative and analytical. I’m constantly running A/B tests on headlines, creative angles, and audience segments to see what moves the needle. I’ve also led collaboration between dev teams and marketers to ensure conversion tracking is clean and actionable.

I’ll be adding more products later this month. The budget is currently small, but I’m ready to scale quickly and invest more as soon as results improve. My goal is to build a long-term relationship with someone I can trust to grow the brand with me. Could you share what next steps you’d recommend?

WRITE YOUR OWN STORY",,"Initial outreach from lead, establishing contact and interest","I've managed over $20M in ad spend and audited 200+ ad accounts. I’ve attached case studies showing how I’ve scaled local service businesses with Google and Meta Ads. I specialize in running ads for service-based, local companies and have deep experience with call tracking setups like CallRail and Hyros. For a foundation repair client, I set up full-funnel Google Ads with conversion tracking and CallRail integration, generating a 5.6x ROAS within 90 days. I ensure tracking is airtight from Google Tag Manager to custom conversions and verify everything is working properly inside the ad platforms. I don’t charge based on ad spend, never use black-hat tactics, and always provide clear, transparent reporting. I meet deadlines, hit KPIs, and adapt strategy as needed. If you’re looking for results and accountability, I’d love to show you what I can do. -Samuel Rainey Case4.pdf Case5.pdf Case2.pdf Case3.pdf Case1.pdf"

I launched about three months ago and have been running everything myself so far. I’ve seen some promising early traction, but I believe I can scale more efficiently and profitably with the right partner. I came across your profile, and your experience seems well aligned with what I’m looking for. I think we could work really well together. Here’s a link to my website so you can get a feel for the brand: writeyourownstory.world Right now, I’m starting with a premium pen line and a notebook as a post-purchase upsell. I’ll be adding more products later this month. The budget is currently small, but I’m ready to scale quickly and invest more as soon as results improve.

Kazi N.,,"Initial outreach from lead, establishing contact and interest","I’ve managed over $20 million in ad spend across Meta and Google Ads and audited over 200 accounts. I’ve attached case studies to showcase the results I’ve delivered for clients through strategic campaign optimization. I’ve seen this issue with Squarespace and Meta Pixel setups before, and I’d be happy to step in quickly. Custom audiences not populating despite event activity showing in Meta is often related to either misfired Pixel events, incorrect match keys, or domain configuration issues. I recently helped a client resolve a similar case where PageView events were registering but audiences weren’t building. After a full audit, we corrected the event deduplication issue and implemented proper parameters to ensure the audiences were refreshed in real time. I’ll start by auditing your Pixel integration via Events Manager, then validate the event quality and audience settings directly within your Business Manager. From there, I can make recommendations or directly implement fixes to get your audiences back on track. This kind of issue can directly impact retargeting and optimization, so resolving it quickly is crucial. I’d love to get access and start the audit ASAP to help restore your Meta audience functionality. Samuel Rainey Case1.pdf Case2.pdf Case3.pdf Case4.pdf Case5.pdf"

I’ve attached case studies to showcase the results I’ve delivered for clients through strategic campaign optimization. For established Google Ads accounts—especially in competitive B2B SaaS verticals—fresh insights often come from reevaluating foundational decisions. I specialize in deep-dive audits that go beyond surface-level metrics to uncover gaps in campaign structure, keyword logic, bidding strategy, and targeting assumptions. I’ve worked with SaaS platforms where legacy campaigns slowly lost efficiency, and in each case, my recommendations led to sharper targeting, reduced wasted spend, and stronger conversion rates. If needed, I can also evaluate your conversion tracking setup via GA4 and Tag Manager, assess attribution models, and offer guidance on aligning ad strategy with your customer journey. While I won’t implement directly, I’ll provide a clear, prioritized roadmap with strategic reasoning so your team knows exactly what to do next. My goal is always to combine technical precision with business-savvy recommendations that drive growth. I’d love to learn more about your platform and help bring new clarity, smarter spend, and performance-enhancing strategy to your ad account. —Samuel Rainey Case1.pdf Case2.pdf Case3.pdf Case4.pdf Case5.pdf"

Unfortunately no marketing platform or freelancer can guarantee you results, and I've found that it's better to do it right the first time than do it half way and when it doesn't work, never know if it actually could have worked if you went all in. I'm sure you've had some experience in the past where you took a chance on a marketing strategy and it didn't work out, which I'm pretty sure every business owner has, and honestly if you haven't, you aren't trying hard enough lol. I've always found the smaller the budget, the less likely you are to get results, and the bigger spender, while not all of them get the CPA they are shooting for (any one who says they have a 100% success rate is lying) they at least see some return. I know this probably doesn't change your situation, and if you are still looking to do ads, I have a freelancer that I work with occasionally and works with smaller accounts, you might want to give him a shout. https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/tariqn13 Do keep in mind it takes 60-90 for campaigns to start producing positive results, so if you aren't willing to invest for a few months, I'd save your money.

Randall C.,,"First response from lead, showing interest and asking questions","I’ve managed over $20 million in ad spend across Google and Facebook Ads and audited over 200 accounts. I’ve attached case studies to show how I’ve helped local service providers across the U.S. improve lead quality, reduce wasted spend, and make confident decisions based on clear, data-driven recommendations. I work almost exclusively with service-based businesses, including dental offices, law firms, auto shops, med spas, and home service providers. I know the patterns, the pain points, and what to look for when evaluating performance. One auto repair client north of Atlanta was able to cut their cost per conversion in half without increasing budget, just by applying audit recommendations I provided. I’ve built internal systems and checklists to guide my process and ensure nothing is missed, whether I’m reviewing structure, keyword strategy, ad assets, or conversion tracking. If your team is handling implementation and just needs clear, strategic guidance, that’s exactly what I provide. I’m also happy to review updates once they’re live and offer feedback to make sure everything is moving in the right direction. Let me know how you'd like to begin. I’d be glad to take a look and get the ball rolling. -Samuel Rainey"

With a $50/month AI signal offer, I’d lead with performance-backed proof (even if it’s demo data) and differentiate on clarity, not hype. One angle that’s worked well in past day trading offers: reframing signals as “decisions made for you” instead of just alerts. That resonates especially with newer traders burnt out from decision fatigue. I’ve managed performance campaigns for financial SaaS and trading signal platforms before, strictly Meta and Google. Across $20M+ in spend and 200+ audits, I’ve found that ad creative wins by being visually confident, not flashy. For your funnel, I’d suggest stat overlays, mobile-first ad ratios, and a rapid ad-testing matrix to validate hooks like outperforming the market or AI vs. emotion early. Are you currently using short-form video in your ad creative mix? I can help storyboard or build those too using real dashboard snippets or motion text. Let me know if you’d like to walk through a few ad ideas or see examples of what’s worked in this space.

If you're looking for someone to take full ownership of your Google Ads from campaign builds and daily optimizations to keyword strategy, audience targeting, A/B testing, and reporting I can help. I focus on building lean, high-performing structures that convert. Recently, I overhauled a local services account by refining match types, restructuring bidding, and improving asset combinations across Performance Max, which led to a 44% increase in lead volume in under four weeks. I’m well-versed in GA4, Google Tag Manager, and all aspects of conversion tracking to ensure accurate data drives every decision.

Additionally the conversion tracking defintely needs to get fixed up badly. It would take me a week to get the campaigns set up, I would need you to allow me 3-4 weeks of spending $400 a day ($100 for each campaign type) if possible to allow me to optimize the campaigns back to where we are bringing in consistent work and the ads pay for themselves. I would also caution against turning the ads off once we get them rolling, because when you turn them back on they take time to optimize again. What we can do instead is reduce the ad spend so they never turn off fully, and can get ramped up whenever needed. I can do this first month trial period for $600. If it works and we continue to work together, I will continue to charge $600 a month base + 10% commission.

Also, these campaigns would have to unlearn all of the crap they’ve been doing for the past years, as opposed to new campaigns with no bad habits. The reason I don’t have lower price tiers is because I only work with businesses that have the budget to win on Google, and so I can set aside enough time to make sure that will happen. You’re ads may be more simple than other industries, which is why im actually discounting my services and not charging a percentage of ad spend, but it clearly isn’t easy to win, as the past few freelancers have shown. If you looking to price shop and get the most affordable option, I’m not your guy. If you want it done right and give the best possible chance of success, I’m your guy. I totally understand if it’s not in your budget, but if you’re spending a few hundred a day on ads, spending 2 days of ad spend to make sure $1000s are not going down the drain is a good idea"

I’ve attached case studies to showcase the results I’ve delivered for clients through strategic campaign optimization. This role stood out immediately my specialty is scaling e-commerce and DTC brands through data-backed media buying and creative iteration. I’ve led campaigns across Meta, and Google (Search, Shopping, Display, and Performance Max) and I’m fluent in reading data to drive actionable change. For example, I recently took over a struggling Performance Max campaign for a skincare brand and increased ROAS by 68% within 45 days by restructuring asset groups and refining audience signals. I consistently run A/B tests on creatives and landing pages and work closely with designers to ensure high-impact visuals and messaging. I’m well-versed in setting up exclusions, lookalikes, retargeting flows, and managing budget pacing to scale winning campaigns. I’ve also used tools like Northbeam and Triple Whale to deepen attribution insights and help clients better understand their full funnel performance. I’m available during Pacific Time hours and have worked with both in-house teams and agencies like Duct Tape Marketing and FirstUp Marketing to deliver consistent growth. I’d love to learn more about your creative strategy process and see how I can bring clarity, stronger ROAS, and streamlined campaign management to your ad operations. —Samuel Rainey Case1.pdf Case2.pdf Case3.pdf Case4.pdf Case5.pdf"

Happy to discuss in more detail if needed. I understand the unique challenges of reverse mortgage advertising, from targeting the right senior audience to ensuring ad copy and landing pages remain compliant. My approach includes a structured keyword and audience strategy, ongoing A/B testing across Search, Display, and Performance Max, and deep analysis of cost-per-conversion to make data-driven optimizations. I’ve successfully managed budgets of $20K+ per month, driving high-quality leads through precise targeting, ad copy refinement, and seamless tracking implementation with Google Tag Manager and Looker Studio. I would charge $2500 a month for setting up the account and managing a budget of $20-30k I’ve attached case studies and examples of high-performing Google Ads campaigns I’ve managed, along with a breakdown of my strategic approach to campaign structure and optimization.

That’s exactly how I approach every project. I’ve helped e-commerce brands scale from $5K to over $50K/month in revenue by not only optimizing Facebook and Instagram campaigns, but also by advising on conversion rate improvements, upsell strategies, and audience building. Given your product—a neck and shoulder pain relief pillow—I’d focus first on tightening your offer positioning, improving landing page clarity, and building high-intent audiences. I have extensive experience in Meta Ads, GA4 analytics, and full-funnel growth strategies, all of which will be crucial to helping you hit your revenue goals. My attached case studies reflect similar health and wellness products where we grew sales significantly through data-driven ad strategies and business coaching.

Additionally, Facebook has a period that is known as the Learning Phase, which will take 2 weeks for the ads to escape. During this Learning Phase, the algorithm will identify which audience works best for your company, but you will see slow sales. We take 1 week (just as long as you, the client, give us the requirements like granting access, inputting credit card info, and reviewing the ads when we map out when those things should be done) to audit and build your campaigns. So, you will not see fully optimized results till month 2. This is not a maybe, this is standard Meta practice. The biggest thing I need to know is your monthly budget.

I’ve successfully managed campaigns for both B2B and B2C businesses, generating high-quality leads and maximizing ROI. Given your two businesses—one targeting homeowners for environmental services and the other focusing on commercial property owners for asphalt maintenance—I can develop a targeted ad strategy to drive results for both. For your environmental company, I’d focus on Facebook Ads to reach homeowners in the right areas, using precise geo-targeting, interest-based audiences, and engaging creatives to generate cost-effective leads. We can also implement retargeting campaigns to capture users who have engaged but haven’t converted. For your asphalt maintenance business, Google Ads will be key in capturing high-intent searches from commercial property managers, facility owners, and decision-makers actively looking for solutions. We’ll use strategic keyword targeting, optimized ad copy, and conversion-focused landing pages to drive high-quality leads. Since you’re open to residential jobs in the right areas, we can also run a focused Facebook campaign promoting your pothole special to select neighborhoods. With your graphic designer handling creatives and landing pages, I’ll ensure your campaigns are fully optimized with A/B testing, data-driven adjustments, and a budget allocation strategy that maximizes efficiency.

I’ve attached case studies to showcase the results I’ve delivered for clients through strategic campaign optimization. I’ve worked extensively in high-compliance verticals like financial services and know how to structure Google Ads campaigns that not only drive exclusive, high-quality leads but also stay within Google’s advertising policies. For debt settlement lead generation, I focus on strategic audience segmentation, tailored ad copy, and compliant funnel design ensuring campaigns avoid disapprovals while still converting. I’ve lowered cost per lead in similar industries by refining landing pages, setting up precise conversion tracking through Tag Manager and GA4, and running controlled A/B tests to optimize both ad messaging and user flow. If you need verifiable performance data, I’m happy to walk through past results that show clear CPL and lead quality outcomes from debt relief-style offers.

2025-04-03,82,2,Direct pricing inquiry,Healthcare,Budget inquiry with value proposition,Audit pricing + Call option + Value proposition,I'll pull that together and send it to you.,,"First response from lead, showing interest and asking questions","I’ve managed over $20 million in ad spend across Google and Facebook Ads and audited over 200 accounts. I’ve attached case studies from past campaigns so you can see the kind of results I’ve helped other businesses achieve—always focused on performance, not fluff. I’ve run Meta campaigns for DTC and retail brands spending anywhere from $10K to $100K+ a month. One example: I helped a med spa with three locations drop their cost per lead to 1/5 the industry average while doubling their booked clients. Another was a home services brand where we beat competitors with 1/3 the average CPL—on the same budget. I’ve done this by getting the creative and funnel strategy right, then backing it up with clean data and smart testing. I can do the same here. If you brought me in on a struggling campaign, my first move would be to audit what’s live now—what’s working, what’s wasting spend, and what’s missing. I’d dig into the structure, audience segmentation, creative breakdowns, and where the funnel’s leaking. Then I’d map out quick wins and a plan to rebuild or scale what’s already showing promise. I’m cool with jumping in as a low-bandwidth advisor at first and dialing things up as you grow. I’ve worked inside other teams, taken point on strategy, and even been client-facing when needed—whatever helps move things forward. Availability-wise, I’m ready to get involved and grow with a team that’s serious about what they’re building. Sounds like that’s what you’ve got here. —Samuel Rainey"

The landing page from your current campaign could also use some improvement, may be better off just sending people to you actual website. It'll be $600 for me to audit all historical GA4 and Google Ads data, as well as the google ads account as a whole for any addition set up errors, implement conversion tracking, optimize your current campaign using historical data provided it is salvageable, and set up a new campaign if not. I'll also get us an action plan from how we will improve the ads from there once we have better data from better set up campaigns.

I am running into the health in personalized advertising policy around 95% of the keywords I'm trying to use in your campaigns, so I've requested an exemption and am now just waiting to hear back from Google on if we are approved.

Are you available? (btw i am from Nashville:)",,"Initial outreach from lead, establishing contact and interest","Had a bit more time to write my thoughts down today as to how I would pitch this idea to both customers and freelancers like yourself (still brainstorming tho): A consultant collective. We were getting thrashed by the bigger agencies who had much more firepower than us in terms of of backing, so we thought why not join forces. Each of us is still an independent operator, but we pool our collective knowledge and experience together under 1 roof, so we are constantly improving each others skills. Basically communism at its finest. The problem with an agency is that you have a whole team working on ur project that you never meet or can trust (basically just being outsourced, and u have to deal with acct managers who don’t do any of the actual work), but they can scale super well. Problem with a single consultant is they may be incredible at their job, but there’s only 1 of them. Only the consultant you speak with is incharge of your project, but if you need to scale we have other consultants on staff that use the same processes as the first, so there’d be no interrupt in service or loss of quality. They can also get multiple pairs of eyes on ur campaign if there’s ever a 50/50 question, guaranteeing ur getting the best management. They can also pull from a wider array of past campaign performance to optimize their campaigns now. And we’ll have a support team to help do any of the repetitive dirty work that doesn’t involve strategy,giving them more time to focus on your campaign strategy Wednesday, Mar 05"

That's why it would be a percentage, essentially Creekside invest time and resources into you, and exchange they own say 20% or whatever of the revenue you do. The pitch to you specifically (and others like you) would be you could have 10 hours a week at $20 an hour and own 100% of that, or you could have 20 hours a week at $50 and hour and own 80% of that ($40 an hour), along with free resources, expenses paid for, coaching, account management help, etc. once again still brainstorming, but I think this is closer to the finished idea that I'm going for and eventually we'd even train guys up on the inside to get their own accounts, but that's way longer term"

Your benefits: - access to dozens of accounts in dozens of industries to use as success stories w/ leads - help scaling by providing talent to handle repetative and low level tasks - acct reviews whenever neeeded for struggling accts (helps with client retention) - advice & feedback on calls and messages between customers to improve your close rate - access to paid for tools like SEMrush, Clcikup project management, Pinnacle CRM, Clickminded proposal builder + SOPs - access to all lead magnets and internal SOPs - posting across social networks to build your personal brand (this will be better as we grow) - we'll pay for certain marketing expenses like connects (this would probably done in the form of expense reports at end of month) What we get: - 25% of revenue from all clients gained after agreement is signed (directly or indirectly as a result of our help). That 25% will never put you below your base rate (in your case $20 an hour) - if freelancer decides to end agreement at any point, Creekside would retain rights to 25% of revenue in perpetuity. If freelancer leaves industry altogether, ownership of clients would revert back to Creekside (or if accounts are sold Creekside would be entitled to 25% of proceeds) also I think this idea is coming together much more quickly than I anticipated.
